<p align="center">Scripts for Yousician (PC/Mac).  We ask, the community delivers.</p>
<h2>What is Wesician?</h2>
<p>Simply, Wesician is a collection of scripts to do things with Yousician that was not intended by the <a href="https://yousician.com/">original developers</a>.

<p>This is a hobby project that I do in my spare time.  <b>I can not be held responsible for anything you do with this software.</b></p>
<p>Do not use this software to pirate music, etc.  I intentionally made this software require that you would need a legit Yousician account with access to the songs you would like to do things with.  <i>This was a conscious decision, please respect that.</i></p>
